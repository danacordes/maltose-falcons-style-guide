  <div data-role="content">
  		<h1>1.1 American-Style Pale Lager (includes Standard and Premium American-Style Pale Lagers)</h1>

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span>Little to no malt aroma. Hop aroma may range from none to light flowery hop presence. Slight fruity aromas from yeast and hop varieties used may exist
    as well as perceptible levels of green apples due to acetaldehyde. Low levels of "cooked-corn" aroma from DMS may be present. No diacetyl.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span>Very pale straw to pale gold color. White head seldom persists. Very clear. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor</span>Crisp and dry flavor with some low levels of sweetness. Hop flavor ranges from none to low levels. Hop bitterness at low to medium levels. Balance may
    vary from slightly malty to slightly bitter, but is relatively close to even. High levels of carbonation may provide a slight acidity or dry "sting." No diacetyl. No fruitiness.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span> Mouthfeel:</span> Very light body from use of a high percentage of adjuncts such as rice or corn. Very well
    </p>
    <p>
    carbonated with slight carbonic bite on the tongue. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> Very refreshing and thirst quenching. "Light" beers will have a lower gravity and less resulting alcohol than the standard. Premium
    beers tend to have fewer adjuncts or can be all-malt.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span>Two or six row barley with high percentage (up to 40%) of rice or corn as adjuncts. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Vital Statistics:</span> OG: 1.035 -1.050, FG: 1.008 - 1.012, ABV: 3.5 - 5.1%, IBU: 8 - 22, SRM: 2 - 8.

  </div>
  <div data-role="content">
  		<h1>1.2 American-Style Pre-Prohibition Lager</h1>

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span>Low to medium clean, grainy and sweet maltiness may be evident. Medium to high hop aroma,often classic noble hops. No fruitiness or diacetyl. Some
    "cooked-corn" aroma due to DMS may be noticeable.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span>Light to gold color. Substantial, long lasting head. Bright clarity. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor</span> Medium to high maltiness.Slight grainy sweetness from the use of maize with substantial offsetting hop bitterness. Medium to high hop flavor from
    noble hops. Medium to high hop bitterness. No fruitiness or diacetyl. <span>Mouthfeel:</span> Medium body and rich, creamy mouthfeel. Medium to high carbonation levels. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> A substantial pilsner that can stand up to the classic European pilsners, but exhibiting the native American grains and water available
    to German brewers who initially brewed it in the USA. Refreshing, but with the underlying malt and hops that stand out when compared to other modern American Pale Lagers. The maize presents a
    unique grainy sweetness that is indicative of the style.
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>Comments:</span> Brewed both pre-prohibition and post-prohibition with some differences. OGs of 1.050 - 1.060 would have been appropriate for pre-prohibition
    beers while gravities dropped to 1.044-1.049 after prohibition. Corresponding IBUs dropped from a pre-prohibition level of 25-40 to 20-35 after prohibition. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span>A version of pilsner brewed in the USA by immigrant German brewers who brought the process and yeast with them when they settled in America. They
    worked with the ingredients that were native to America to create a unique version of the orignial pilsner. This style died out with prohibition but was resurrected as a homebrew style by
    advocates of the hobby.
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>Ingredients:</span> Six row barley with 20% to 30% flaked maize to dilute the excessive protein levels. Native American hops such as Clusters or traditional noble
    German hops. Modern Hallertau crosses (Ultra, Liberty, Crystal) are ideal for this beer. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Vital Statistics:</span> OG: 1.044 - 1.060, FG: 1.010 - 1.015, ABV: 4.5 - 6.0%, IBU: 25 - 40, SRM: 3 - 6.

  		<h1>1.3 American-Style Red Lager</h1>

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span>Low malt aroma manifests itself as graininess. Hop aroma may range from none to light flowery hop presence. Slight fruity aromas from yeast and hop
    varieties used may exist. Low levels of "cooked-corn" aroma due to DMS may be noticeable. No diacetyl. 
    </p>

    <p>
    <span>Flavor</span>  Crisp with some low levels of sweetness. No to very low levels of toasted malt. Hop flavor ranges from none to low levels. Hop bitterness at low to
    medium levels. No diacetyl. No fruitiness. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel:</span>Light to somewhat medium body. Smooth, although a well carbonated beer.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> A red-colored version of American Lager beer.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>A derivative of the American Pale Lager style that leans toward the German Marzen style, using small amounts of dark malts to achieve a red color
    and sometimes a light toasty-malty flavor as well. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span>  Inspired by German Marzen and Vienna beers, but brewed for American tastes and with American ingredients and methods.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span>Two or six row barley, corn or rice as adjuncts and small amounts of dark malts for color.

  		<h1>1.4 American-Style Dark Lager</h1>

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span>Little to no malt aroma. Little or no roast malt aroma since the color is usually derived artificially from the addition of dark caramel brewing
    syrups. Hop aroma may range from none to light flowery hop presence. Slight fruity aromas from yeast and hop varieties used may exist. Low levels of "cooked-corn" aroma due to DMS may be
    noticeable. No diacetyl.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span>Deep copper to dark brown with bright clarity. Foam stand may not be long lasting. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor</span>Crisp with some low levels of sweetness. No to very low levels of roasted malt; often the dark color is from dark caramel brewing syrups rather than
    roasted malts. Hop flavor ranges from none to low levels. Hop bitterness at low to medium levels. No diacetyl. No fruitiness. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel:</span>  Light to somewhat medium body. Smooth, although a well carbonated beer. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> A dark-colored version of American Lager Beer.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>Little or no dark malts used. Somewhat sweeter than its pale cousins, with a little more body. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span>  Inspired by the Munich Dunkel style, but brewed for American tastes and with American ingredients and methods. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span>Two or six row barley, corn or rice as adjuncts and potentially artificially colored with dark caramel brewing syrups. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Vital Statistics:</span> OG: 1.040 - 1.050, FG: 1.010 - 1.012, ABV: 4.1 - 5.1%, IBU: 14 - 20, SRM: 10 - 20.

  		<h1>2.1 Munich-Style Helles</h1>
 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span> Grain and malt aromas predominate. May also have a very light hop aroma. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span> Medium to deep gold, clear, with a creamy white head. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor</span> Slightly sweet, malty profile. Grain and malt flavors predominate, with just enough hop bitterness to balance. Very slight hop flavor acceptable.
    Finish and aftertaste remain malty. No fruitiness or esters. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel:</span> Medium body, medium carbonation, smooth maltiness with no trace of astringency. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> Characterized by rounded maltiness without heaviness.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span> Unlike Pilsner but like its cousin, Munchner Dunkel, Helles is a malt-accentuated beer that is not overly sweet, but rather focuses on malt flavor
    with underlying hop bitterness in a supporting role. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span> Created in Munich in 1895 at the Spaten brewery by Gabriel Sedlmayr to compete with Pilsner style beers. <span class=
    "cleanuphtml-2">Ingredients:</span> Moderate carbonate and sulfate water, pilsner malt, German hop varieties. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Vital Statistics:</span> OG: 1.044 - 1.055, FG: 1.012 - 1.017, ABV: 4.5 - 5.5%, IBU: 18 - 25, SRM: 3 - 5.

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span> Rich with a complex malt and a spicy, floral, Saaz hop bouquet. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span> Light gold to deep copper-gold, clear, with a dense, creamy white head. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor</span> Rich complex maltiness combined with pronounced soft, rounded bitterness and flavor from Saaz hops. Moderate diacetyl acceptable. Bitterness is
    prominent but never harsh, and does not linger: the aftertaste is balanced between malt and hops. No fruitiness or esters.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel:</span> Medium bodied, medium carbonation. Low to medium astringency from the hop bitterness which should not be overdone. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> Crisp, complex and well-rounded yet refreshing.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span> Uses Moravian malted barley and a decoction mash for rich malt character. Saaz hops, and low sulfate and low carbonate water provide a
    distinctively soft, rounded hop profile despite a relatively high bittering rate. <span>History:</span> First brewed in 1842, this style was the original clear
    light-colored beer. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span> Low sulfate and low carbonate water, Saaz hops, Moravian malted barley. 
    </p>

    <span>Vital Statistics:</span> OG: 1.044 - 1.056, FG: 1.013 - 1.017, ABV: 4.0 - 5.3%, IBU: 35 - 45, SRM: 3 - 5.

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span> May feature grain and distinctive, flowery, noble hops. No fruitiness or esters. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span> Straw to  medium gold, clear, with a creamy white head. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor</span> Crisp, dry and bitter. Maltiness is low, although some grainy flavors and slight sweetness are acceptable. Hop bitterness dominates taste and
    continues through the finish and lingers into the aftertaste. Hop flavor can range from low to high but should only be derived from German noble hops. No fruitiness or esters. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel:</span> Light to medium body, medium to high carbonation, medium to high astringency from the hop bitterness. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> Crisp, clean, refreshing beer that prominently features noble German hop bitterness accentuated by sulfates in the water. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span> Drier than Bohemian Pilsner with a bitterness that tends to linger more in the aftertaste due to higher attenuation and higher-sulfate water.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span> A copy of Bohemian Pilsner adapted to brewing conditions in Northern and Central Germany. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span> Pilsner malt, German hop varieties (especially noble varieties for taste and aroma), medium sulfate water.

    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span> Light gold to medium gold, clear with a noticeable white head. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor</span> Neither malt nor hops are distinctive, but both are in good balance with a touch of sweetness, providing a smooth yet crisply refreshing beer.
    Balance continues through the finish and the hop bitterness lingers in aftertaste. No fruitiness or esters. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel:</span> Medium body, medium carbonation, slight astringency from the hops acceptable but should be mostly absent in the face of the firm body.

    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> Balance and mineral character are the hallmarks of this style. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span> Brewed to a slightly higher starting gravity than other light lagers, providing a firm malty body and underlying maltiness to complement the
    sulfate-accentuated hop bitterness. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span> A style indigenous to the Dortmund industrial region, Export has been on the decline in Germany in recent years. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span> High sulfate water, German or Czech hops, Pilsner malt.

  		<h1>3.1 American-Style Wheat Ale</h1>

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span>Characteristic of wheat with some graininess. Weizen clovey and banana aromas are inappropriate. Hop aroma may be high or low but if present will be

    <p>
    <span>Flavor</span>Light graininess. Hop flavor may be from low to high. Hop bitterness low to medium. Some fruitiness from ale fermentations acceptable however the use

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span> Light to moderate sweet malty aroma.  Low to moderate fruitiness is optional, but acceptable.  May have a low to medium hop aroma, and can reflect
    almost any hop variety.  No diacetyl.  
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span> Light yellow to deep gold in color.  Clear to brilliant.  Low to medium white head with fair to good retention.

    <p>
    <span>Flavor:</span> Initial soft malty sweetness, but optionally some light character malt flavor (e.g., bread, toast, biscuit, wheat) can also be present.  Caramel
    flavors typically absent.  Low to medium esters optional, but are commonly found in many examples.  Light to moderate hop flavor (any variety), but shouldn't be overly aggressive.  Low to
    medium bitterness, but the balance is normally towards the malt.  Finishes medium-dry to somewhat sweet.  No diacetyl.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel</span><span>:</span> Medium-light to medium body.  Medium to high carbonation.  Smooth without harsh bitterness or astringency.

    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span>Easy-drinking, approachable, malt-oriented American craft beer.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span> Currently produced by many (American) microbreweries and brewpubs.  Regional variations exist (many West Coast brewpub examples are more assertive,
    like pale ales) but in most areas this beer is designed as the entry-level craft beer.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span> In addition to the more common American Blonde Ale, this category can also include modern English Summer Ales, American Kölsch-style beers, and
    less assertive American and English pale ales.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span> Generally all malt, but can include up to 25% wheat malt and some sugar adjuncts.  Any hop variety can be used.  Clean American, lightly fruity
    English, or Kölsch yeast.  May also be made with lager yeast, or cold-conditioned.  Some versions may have honey, spices and/or fruit added, although if any of these ingredients are stronger
    than a background flavor they should be entered in specialty, spiced or fruit beer categories instead.  Extract versions should only use the lightest malt extracts and avoid kettle
    caramelization.

  		<h1>4.1 Ordinary Bitter</h1>

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span>Hop aroma can range from moderate to none.  Diacetyl and caramel aromas also moderate to none. Should have mild to moderate fruitiness. The best
    examples have some malt aroma.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span>Medium gold to medium copper-brown.  May have very little head due to low carbonation.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor:</span>Medium to high bitterness.  May or may not have hop flavor, diacetyl and fruitiness.  Crystal malt flavor very common.  Balance varies from even to
    decidedly bitter, although the bitterness should not completely overpower the malt flavor.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel:</span>Light to medium-light body.  Carbonation low, although bottled examples can have moderate carbonation.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> Low gravity, low alcohol levels and low carbonation make this an easy-drinking beer.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span>Originally a draught ale served very fresh under no pressure (gravity or hand pump only) at cellar temperatures.  Note that recently some British
    brewers have been using American hops (e.g., Cascade), but beers made like this fit better into the American pale ale guideline.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>The lightest of the bitters.

    Ingredients: Pale ale malt, crystal malts, English hops, often medium sulfate water are used.

  		<h1>4.2 Special or Best Bitter</h1>

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span>Hop aroma can range from high to none.  Diacetyl and caramel aroma moderate to none. Moderate fruitiness.  The best examples have some malt aroma.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span>Medium gold to medium copper-brown.  May have very little head due to low carbonation.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor:</span>Diacetyl and fruitiness moderate to none.  Malt flavor apparent. Medium to high bitterness.  Some crystal malt flavor and a moderate amount of hop
    flavor are common.  Balance varies from even to decidedly bitter, although the bitterness should not completely overpower the malt flavor.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel:</span>Medium-light to medium body.  Carbonation low, although bottled examples can have moderate carbonation.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> A flavorful, yet refreshing, session beer.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span>Originally a draught ale served very fresh under no pressure (gravity or hand pump only) at cellar temperatures.  Note that recently some British
    brewers have been using American hops (e.g., Cascade), but beers made like this fit better into the American pale ale guideline.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>More evident malt flavor than in an ordinary bitter.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span>Pale ale malt, crystal malt, English hops, often medium sulfate water is used.

  		<h1>5.1 American-Style Pale Ale</h1>

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span>Usually moderate to strong hop aroma from dryhopping or late kettle additions of American hop
    </p>
    <p>
    varieties. Citrusy hop aroma very common. Esters vary from low to high. Diacetyl moderate to none. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span>Pale golden to amber. <span>Flavor</span> Often moderate to high hop flavor. Citrusy hop flavor very common (such as from
    Cascades), but also other American hop variety flavors are found. Malt flavor moderate relative to aggressive hop flavor and bitterness. Balance towards bitterness. Caramel flavor is usually
    restrained. Diacetyl moderate to none. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel:</span>Many are rather light, refreshing and more highly carbonated than other styles, but body can reach medium. Carbonation borders on effervescent in
    some examples.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> An American adaptation of English Pale Ale. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>American Pale Ales differ from American Amber Ales not only by being lighter in color, but also in having less caramel flavor and usually being
    balanced more towards hop bitterness. American Pale Ales are often lighter in color than English ones. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span>An American adaptation of English Pale Ale. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span>Pale Ale malt, typically American 2-row. Light to medium crystal malts. American hops, often the citrusy ones such as Cascade, Centennial and
    Columbus, but others may also be used (e.g. Brewer's Gold or Willamette). Water can vary in sulfate content, but is often lower than in English versions and the carbonate content should be
    relatively low.

    <span>Aroma:</span>Malt is evident; some examples have a low level of hop aroma. Fruitiness low to none. A very faint smoky and/or toasty/roasty characteristic sometimes
    present. May have some diacetyl.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span>Amber to dark brown. Draught examples often have a creamy, long-lasting head.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor:</span>Malt-dominated flavor, with subdued esters and just enough hop bitterness to prevent the beer from being cloyingly sweet. A very slight toasty,
    roasty and/or chocolate-like character is sometimes present.  Caramel flavor from crystal malt medium to none.  May have some diacetyl.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel:</span>Creamy, with low carbonation. Body is medium-light, but full for the gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> Cleanly malty, with perhaps a faint touch of smoke and few esters.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span>More recent commercial interpretations from Scotland have begun to drift towards English bitter in terms of bitterness, balance, attenuation, esters
    and dry-hopping.  These guidelines don't account for these recent commercial examples which would more accurately be described as bitters.  Traditionally, these beers were dispensed via
    pumps, which forced air into the headspace of the cask, thus forcing the beer out. These air-powered systems are referred to as "tall fonts."  The "light" name associated with this style
    refers to the gravity rather than the color.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>Though similar in gravity to ordinary bitter, the malt-hop balance is decidedly to the malt side. Long, cool fermentation leads to clean malt
    character (which may include some faint peat or smoke character). Note that the smoky character can be due to the yeast as often as to smoked or peat-kilned malt.  Strongly smoky beers should
    be entered in the Smoked Beer category rather than here.
    </p>
    <p>
    Ingredients: Scottish or English pale malt with small proportions of roasted barley, crystal or chocolate malt. English hops. Clean, relatively un-attenuative ale yeast.

  		<h1>6.4. Irish Red Ale</h1>


    <p>
    <span>Aroma</span>: Low to moderate malt aroma, generally caramel-like but occasionally toasty or toffee-like in nature.  May have a light buttery character (although
    this is not required).  Hop aroma is low to none (usually not present).  Quite clean.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance</span>: Amber to deep reddish copper color (most examples have a deep reddish hue).  Clear.  Low off-white to tan colored head.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor</span>: Moderate caramel malt flavor and sweetness, occasionally with a buttered toast or toffee-like quality.  Finishes with a light taste of roasted
    grain, which lends a characteristic dryness to the finish.  Generally no flavor hops, although some examples may have a light English hop flavor.  Medium-low hop bitterness, although light
    use of roasted grains may increase the perception of bitterness to the medium range.  Medium-dry to dry finish.  Clean and smooth (lager versions can be very smooth).  No esters.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel</span>: Medium-light to medium body, although examples containing low levels of diacetyl may have a slightly slick mouthfeel.  Moderate carbonation. 
    Smooth.  Moderately attenuated (more so than Scottish ales).  May have a slight alcohol warmth in stronger versions.
    </p>
    <p>
    Overall Impression: An easy-drinking pint.  Malt-focused with an initial sweetness and a roasted dryness in the finish.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments</span>: Sometimes brewed as a lager (if so, generally will not exhibit a diacetyl character).  When served too cold, the roasted character and bitterness
    may seem more elevated.
    </p>
    <p>
    Ingredients: May contain some adjuncts (corn, rice, or sugar), although excessive adjunct use will harm the character of the beer.  Generally has a bit of roasted barley to provide reddish
    color and dry roasted finish.  UK/Irish malts, hops, yeast.

    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel:</span>Full-bodied, with a thick, chewy viscosity. Alcoholic warmth should also be present. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> Rich and malty, reminiscent of a dessert. Complex secondary malt flavors prevent a one-dimensional impression. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>Fermented at cooler temperatures than most ales, and with lower hopping rates, resulting in clean, intense malt flavors. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span>Well suited to the region of origin, with abundant malt and cool fermentation and aging temperature. Hops, which are not native to Scotland and
    formerly expensive to import, were kept to a minimum. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span>Well-modified pale malt, with some crystal and perhaps a dash of darker malt or even roasted barley. A small proportionof smoked malt may add
    depth, though smoky character may also originate from the yeast. Hop presence is minimal, although English varieties are most authentic. Low-to-medium sulfate and medium carbonate/bicarbonate
    water is most appropriate. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Vital Statistics:</span> OG: 1.072 - 1.088+, FG: 1.019-1.025+, ABV: 6.9 - 8.5+%, IBU: 20 - 40, SRM: 10 - 47. <i>Commercial Examples: Traquair House Ale.

  		<h1>7.1 English-Style India Pale Ale</h1>

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span>A prominent hop aroma of floral, grassy, or fruity character is typical. A caramel-like or toasty malt presence may also be noted. Fruitiness, either
    from esters or hops, may also be detected. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span>Color ranges from medium gold to deep copper, with good clarity. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor</span>Hop flavor is medium to high from English-type hop varieties, with an assertive hop bitterness. Malt flavor is often low to medium, but should be
    sufficient to support the hop aspect. Despite the substantial hop character typical of these beers, sufficient malt flavor, body and complexity to support the hops will provide the best
    balance. Very low levels of diacetyl are acceptable, and fruitiness from the fermentation or hops should add to the overall complexity.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel:</span>Smooth, medium-bodied mouthfeel without astringency is typical, although moderate carbonation combines to render an overall dry sensation in the
    presence of malt sweetness. Some alcohol warming may be sensed in stronger versions. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> A decidedly hoppy, moderately strong pale ale. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>A pale ale that was brewed to an increased gravity and hop rate. English versions are often darker than American ones. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span>Originally brewed to survive the sea voyage from England to India. The temperature extremes and rolling of the seas resulted in a highly attenuated
    beer upon arrival. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span>Pale ale malt (well-modified and suitable for single-temperature infusion mashing); English hop varieties were originally used. High sulfate and
    low carbonate water is essential to achieving a pleasant hop bitterness.

    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> A hoppy, dark beer with the malt structure and bite of an IPA only darker. This style should not be confused with an American stout or
    porter with their stronger roasted malt presence and flavor.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>A colored strong pale ale brewed to an increased gravity and hopping rate. While the color is dark, the beer's flavor carries none of the heft or
    roast barley characters expected in more traditional porters and stouts.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span>A variant of the West Coast American IPA tradition. The beer is meant to surprise the drinker with its mellow stout like appearance concealing the
    hoppy bite underneath.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span>Pale ale malt (well-modified and suitable for single-temperature infusion mashing); American hop varieties such as Cascade, Centennial, Columbus
    are critical to style. High sulfate and low carbonate water is essential to achieving a pleasant hop bitterness, and many American versions use relatively soft water in their makeup. To
    achieve dark color with minimal roast characters many brewers turn to De-bittered German Chocolate Malts such as Weyermann Carafa Special or use beer colorants like Weyermann's Sinamar.

  <div data-role="content">
  		<h1>8.1 Kolsch-Style Ale</h1>

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span>Light hop aroma, German noble or Czech Saaz hops, giving a light fruitiness. Maltiness none to low. No diacetyl as this is a lagered beer resulting in
    a clean finish with just a hint of fruitiness from primary fermentation at ale temperatures. Low, noticeable levels of DMS or sulfur aroma, similar to pale continental lagers, are acceptable,
    particularly in a young Kolsch. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span>Very pale to light gold. Very clear/brilliant. White head lingers as Belgian lace on the sides of the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor</span>Soft, velvet palate; light hop fruitiness and a delicate dryness to slight sweetness in the finish. Clean fermentation with just a little residual
    fruitiness from ale fermentation temperatures. No diacetyl. Medium bitterness. Balanced toward bitterness but malt character should not be completely overshadowed. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel:</span>Light side of medium body. Medium carbonation. Smooth mouthfeel.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> A delicately balanced beer with just a hint of hops and fruitiness that finishes dry to slightly sweet but very refreshing. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>Brewed at ale temperatures, then cold conditioned to reduce fermentation byproducts. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span>As an appellation, the Kolsch name can only be used for beers brewed in Koln (Cologne), Germany, where it is a native style. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span>European hops only. Pils malt; small amounts of wheat may be used.

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span>Munich malt aroma, with a restrained fruitiness. Hop aroma may vary from low to moderate. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span>Orange-copper to brown color, with brilliant clarity. Thick, persistent head. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor</span> Assertively bitter, with intense Munich malt-derived flavor to support. Fruity esters should be restrained; some chocolatey notes are acceptable. Hop
    flavor should be low to medium. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel:</span>Medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation. Some commercial examples have a dry finish resulting from a combination of high bitterness, higher
    attenuation, and moderate sulfate in the water. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> Bitterness is very high, especially in relation to the (moderate) gravity. Munich malt character lends balance, resulting in a
    bittersweet character. Very clean from fermentation at the lower end of the temperature range for ales, followed by a period of lagering. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>A very bitter beer with a pronounced Munich malt character. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Ingredients, fermentation at low temperature (for an ale), and a lagering period combine to lend a cleaner palate than for most ales.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span>Pre-dates the isolation of bottom fermenting yeast strains, though it approximates many characteristics of lager beers. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span>German Munich malt is essential to obtaining the necessary depth of malt character. Hops are traditionally Spalt, though other German varieties
    are acceptable.

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span>Dark German (Vienna or Munich) malt aroma. A light toasted malt aroma may be present. Similar,
    </p>
    <p>
    though less intense than Oktoberfest. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span>Reddish amber to light brown color. Bright clarity and solid foam stand. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor</span>Soft, elegant malt complexity is in the forefront, with a firm enough hop presence to provide a balanced finish. Some toasted character from the use
    of Vienna malt. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel:</span>Light to medium body, with a gentle creaminess. Medium carbonation. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> Characterized by soft, elegant maltiness that dries out in the finish to avoid becoming overly sweet. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>The style owes much of its character to the method of malting (Vienna malt). Lighter overall than Oktoberfest, yet still decidedly balanced toward
    malt.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span>The original amber lager, developed shortly after the isolation of lager yeast by Anton Dreher. Nearly extinct in its area of origin. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span>Vienna malt provides a lightly toasty and complex, melanoidin-rich malt profile. As with Oktoberfests, only the finest quality malt should be
    used, along with Continental hops (preferably noble varieties). Moderately hard, carbonate-rich water will be balanced by the acidity of dark grains that comprise the bulk of the grist. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Vital Statistics:</span> OG: 1.046 - 1.052, FG: 1.010 - 1.014, ABV: 4.6 - 5.5%, IBU: 18 - 30, SRM: 8 - 12.

    <span>Aroma:</span>German (Vienna or Munich) malt aroma. A light toasted malt aroma may be present. No fruitiness, diacetyl, or hop aroma. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span>Dark gold to reddish amber color. Bright clarity, with solid foam stand. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor</span>Distinctive and complex maltiness may include both caramel and toasted aspects. Hop bitterness is moderate, and hop flavor is low to none. Balance is
    toward malt, though the finish is not sweet. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel:</span>Medium body, with a creamy texture and medium carbonation. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> Smooth and rather rich, with a depth of malt character. This is one of the classic malty styles, with a maltiness that is often
    described as soft, complex, and elegant but never cloying. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>Typically brewed in the spring, signaling the end of the traditional brewing season and stored in cold caves or cellars during the warm summer
    months. Served in autumn amidst traditional celebrations. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span>Origin is credited to Gabriel Sedlmyer, based on an adaptation of the Vienna style developed by Anton Dreher around 1840, shortly after lager yeast
    was first isolated. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span>German Vienna malt (slightly lighter than Munich malt) should be the backbone (if not entirety) of the grain bill, with some Munich malt and
    possibly some crystal malt. All malt should derive from the finest quality two-row barley. Continental hops, especially noble varieties, are most authentic. Should adhere to the
    Reinheitsgebot. Somewhat alkaline water (up to 300 ppm), with significant carbonate content is welcome, due to the large proportion of acidic dark malt in the grist. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Vital Statistics:</span> OG: 1.050 - 1.064, FG: 1.012 - 1.016, ABV: 4.8 - 6.5%, IBU: 20 - 30, SRM: 7 -

  		<h1>9.4 Munich-Style Dunkel</h1>

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span>Munich malt aroma, with sweetish notes or hints of chocolate and toffee also acceptable. No fruity
    </p>
    <p>
    esters or diacetyl should be detected, but slight hop aroma is acceptable. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span>Medium amber to dark brown, often with a red or garnet tint. Creamy light tan head, clear. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor</span>Dominated by the rich and complex flavor of Munich malt. May be slightly sweet from residual extract, but should not have a pronounced crystal or
    caramel malt flavor. Burnt or bitter flavors from roasted malts should not be perceived. Hop bitterness is low but perceptible, with the balance tipped firmly towards maltiness. Hop flavor
    should be at the very edge of perception if perceived at all. Slight sulfur undertones may round out the malt character. Aftertaste remains malty although the hop bitterness may become more
    apparent in this last phase of flavor perception. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel:</span>Medium to medium-full mouthfeel, providing a firm body without being heavy. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> Characterized by depth and complexity of Munich malt and the accompanying melanoidins. <span>Comments:</span>
    Versions from the Kulmbach region of Franconia are brewed from a bit higher gravity with a more intense flavor profile. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span>The classic lager style of Munich which developed as a malt-accented beer in part due to the moderately carbonate water. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span>Grist is primarily made up of German munich malts, as much as 99% in some cases or supplemented with German pilsner malt. Small amounts of
    crystal malt can add to the malt complexity but should not compete with the Munich malt. Very slight additions of roasted malts may be used to improve color but should not add any flavor.
    Noble German hop varieties and German lager yeast strains should be used. Moderately carbonate water. Often decoction mashed to showcase the malt flavors. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Vital Statistics:</span> OG: 1.046 - 1.058, FG: 1.012 - 1.017, ABV: 4.3-5.6%, IBU: 20 - 28, SRM: 12 - 28.
    </p>

  		<h1>9.5 Schwarzbier</h1>

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span>Primarily malty, with low aromatic sweetness and/or hints of roast malt often apparent. Low hop aroma may be perceived. No fruity esters or diacetyl. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor</span>Rich, full malt flavor balanced by moderate bitterness from both hops and roasted malt, providing a bitter-chocolate palate without being particularly
    dry. Low hop flavor and some residual sweetness are acceptable. Aftertaste tends to dry out slowly and linger, featuring hop bitterness with a complementary subtle roastiness in the
    background. No fruity esters or diacetyl. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel:</span>Low to medium body. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> A beer that balances rich dark malt flavors with a perceptible bitterness from hops and roasted malts. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>In comparison with a Munich Dunkel, usually darker in color, drier on the palate and with a noticeable (but not high) roasted malt edge to balance
    the malt base. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span>In previous centuries in Germany, drinkers sometimes sweetened the initial product with sugar, and for some time, the Köstritzer brewery produced
    two versions, an original, drier product and another version with added sucrose. The current Ur-Köstritzer product splits the difference between the two previous versions. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span>German Munich malt and pilsner malts for the base, supplemented by a small amount of roasted malts for the dark color and subtle roast flavors.
    Noble-type German hop varieties and a clean (preferably German) lager yeast are preferred.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Vital Statistics:</span> OG: 1.044 - 1.054, FG: 1.010 - 1.016, ABV: 4.2 - 5.4%, IBU: 25 - 35, SRM: 20 - 40+.

  		<h1>10.1 West Coast Extra Pale Ale</h1>

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span>  Usually moderate to strong hop aroma from dryhopping or late kettle additions of American hop
    </p>
    <p>
    varieties. Citrusy hop aroma very common. Esters vary from low to high. Diacetyl moderate to none. Malt aromas tend to be low in relation to the hops.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span>Pale gold to light amber. Head is generally bright white and crispy. Clarity may suffer from a slight hop haze.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor:</span> Flavor is dominated by hop bitterness and flavor with just enough malt to temper the aggressive hop character. Diacetyl is moderate to none.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel:</span>  Body is light and brisk with a sharp bracing hop character throughout the palate.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> A brisk, hoppier version of the American Pale Ale. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>  This beer presents a similar hop profile to a pale ale or IPA, but with a lighter malt profile to showcase American hops.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span>An offshoot of the American West Coast craft-brewing trend to aggressively hopped beers. This style fills a gap as highly hopped beer that remains
    low in alcohol.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span>2 Row Pale Malt, Light Crystal Malt, American Hops with a tendency towards the citrus character of Cascade, Centennial or Crystal. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Vital Statistics:</span>  OG 1.040-1.055, FG 1.008-1.015, ABV 3.5%-5.5%, IBU 35-55, SRM 4-8 .

  		<h1>10.2 California Common Beer</h1>

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span>May have a pronounced woody or rustic hop aroma (as from Northern Brewer, for example).  Restrained fruitiness. May have a moderate toasted malt
    aroma. Diacetyl low to none. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span>Dark gold to copper to medium amber. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor</span>Malty, balanced with a pronounced hop bitterness. Rustic/woody (e.g. Northern Brewer) hop flavor medium to none. May have a toasted (not roasted) malt
    flavor. Balance is generally about even between malt and hops. Diacetyl low to none.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel:</span>Medium-bodied. Medium to medium-high carbonation. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> A pale beer unique to the U.S. West Coast that combines ale and lager elements. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>Similar to American Pale Ale, although typically less fruity. Hop flavor/aroma may be woody or citrusy in character. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span>American west coast original. Large shallow fermenters are used. Originally, in the absence of handy ice or refrigeration, the locally cool ambient
    temperatures of the San Francisco peninsula led to a beer that was fermented with lager yeast, but at temperatures that were at the cool end of the ale temperature range. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span>Pale Ale Malt, American hops (usually woody, such as Northern Brewer, rather than citrusy), small amounts of toasted malt and/or light
    caramel/crystal malts. Lager yeast, however some strains (often with the mention of "California" in he name) work better than others at the warmer fermentation temperatures (55 to 60F) used
    (some German strains produce excessive sulfur character). Water should have relatively low sulfate and low to moderate carbonate levels.

    <p>
    <span>Vital Statistics:</span> OG: 1.040 - 1.055, FG: 1.010 - 1.014, ABV: 4.0- 5.5%, IBU: 35 - 45, SRM: 8 - 14.

  		<h1>10.3 American-Style Red and Amber Ale</h1>

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span>Often a mild to strong hop aroma from dryhopping or late kettle additions of American hop varieties. Some caramel aroma common. Esters vary from low
    to high. Diacetyl medium-high to none. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span>Light copper to light brown.

    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel:</span>Body is medium to medium-full. Carbonation typically moderate. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> Caramel usually balances the bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>American Amber Ales differ from American-Style Pale Ales not only by being darker in color, but also in having more caramel flavor and usually
    being balanced more evenly even between malt and bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span>Called West Coast Amber Ales by some authors, this subcategory was spun-off from the American Pale Ale style. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span>Pale Ale malt, typically American 2-row. Medium to dark crystal malts. American hops, such as Cascade, Centennial, Brewer's Gold, Columbus and
    Willamette, but others may also be used. Water can vary in sulfate and carbonate content.

  		<h1>10.4 Imperial Pilsner</h1>

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span>Rich with a complex malt and a large spicy, floral hop bouquet. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span>Light gold to deep copper-gold, clear, with a dense, creamy white head. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor</span>Rich complex maltiness combined with pronounced spicy bitterness and flavor from noble hops. Bitterness is prominent but never harsh. The beer is
    balanced between malt and hops. Some fruitiness or esters is acceptable from this higher gravity beer.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel</span><span>:</span> Medium to full bodied, medium carbonation. Medium astringency from the hop bitterness which provides the
    counterbalance to the high gravity. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> Crisp, hoppy, complex, well-rounded and warming yet refreshing. Different from Malt liquor with it's focus on all malt and noble hop
    character with proper lagering to yield a smooth, non sweet, non fruity beer.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>Traditional Czech versions use Moravian malted barley and a decoction mash for rich malt character. Saaz hops, and low sulfate and low carbonate
    water provide a distinctively soft, rounded hop profile despite a relatively high bittering rate.  Modern American versions often use domestic pale malts and American variants of Noble hops.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History</span>: An amped up variation on the classic Pilsners. Not as delicate or crisp as a normal Bohemian Pilsner, but more aggressively hoppy than Maibocks and
    lacking in adjuncts, ala Malt Liquor. Examples are both available from the Czech Republic and the US. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span>Low sulfate and low carbonate water, Noble hops (Sterling, Saaz, Hallertauer), Virtually 100% Pilsner or Pale Malt and a clean lager yeast.

    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span>Medium to dark brown or mahogany color. A few light brown examples exist. May have very little head due to low carbonation.

    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span>Dark brown, almost opaque. 
    </p>

    <span>Appearance:</span>Dark golden to light brown color. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor</span>Gentle to moderate sweetness, with a nutty character. Balance is nearly even, with hop flavor low to none. Some fruity esters should be present; low
    diacetyl is acceptable. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel:</span>Medium-light to medium body, with a dry finish. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> Drier and more hop-oriented that southern English brown ale, with a nutty character rather than caramel.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>English brown ales are generally split into sub-styles along geographic lines. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span>Some well-known versions are 20 th century developments. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span>English mild malt/brown malt as a basis, though English pale may also be used, with a healthy proportion of caramel malts and often some darker
    malts to give color and malt complexity. English hop varieties are most authentic. Moderate carbonate water would appropriately balance the dark malt acidity. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Vital Statistics:</span> OG: 1.040 - 1.050, FG: 1.010 - 1.013, ABV: 4.0 - 5.0%, IBU: 15 - 30, SRM: 12 - 30.

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span>Hop aroma, often citrusy, is mild to strong. Esters and dark malt aspects are mild to moderate.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span>Dark amber to dark brown color. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor</span>Hop bitterness and flavor dominate the malty richness that is a characteristicof brown ales. Slightly drier than English versions, with assertive hop
    presence (bitterness, flavor, and aroma). Although malt flavor plays a supporting role, some toasty malt character (or even restrained roastiness) should be evident. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel:</span>Medium body, with a dry, resiny impression contributed by the high hop bitterness. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> A bigger, hoppier, drier version of brown ale, typically including the citrus-accented hop presence that is characteristic of American
    varieties. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>A more strongly-flavored beer than most English Brown Ales. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span>Adapted by American homebrewers, perhaps in response to the lack of character in many mainstream beers.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span>Well-modified pale male, either American or Continental plus crystal and darker malts should complete the malt bill. American hops should be
    used in generous quantity. Moderate to high carbonate water would appropriately balance the dark malt acidity. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Vital Statistics:</span> OG: 1.040 - 1.060, FG: 1.010 - 1.017, ABV: 4.0 - 6.0%, IBU: 25 - 60, SRM: 15 - 22.

  		<h1>12.1 Old Ale</h1>

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span>Malty, with complex fruity esters. Some oxidative notes are acceptable, akin to those found in port or sherry. Hop aromas not usually present, due to
    extended age. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span>Medium amber to very dark red-amber color. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor</span> Malty and usually sweet, with abundant fruity esters. The nutty malt sweetness yields to a finish that may vary from dry to somewhat sweet. Extended
    aging may contribute oxidative flavors similar to a fine old port or Madiera wine. Alcoholic strength should be evident, though not overwhelming.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel:</span>Medium to full body; alcohol should contribute some warmth. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> An ale of significant alcoholic strength, though usually not as strong or rich as barleywine. Usually tilted toward a sweeter, more
    malty balance. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>Often regarded as winter warmers, and often released as seasonal beers. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span>Historical basis likely dates back to a period when aged beers were highly prized. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span>Generous quantities of well-modified pale malt (generally English in origin, though not necessarily so), along with judicious quantities of
    caramel malts. Some darker examples suggest that dark malts may be appropriate, though sparingly so as to avoid roast character. Adjuncts (such as molasses or dark sugar) may also be
    utilized. Hop variety is not as important, as the relative balance and aging process negate much of the varietal character.

  		<h1>13.1 Wheat Wine</h1>

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span> Sweet fruity wheat malt aromas dominate over a neutral yeast base. Banana esters and cloves phenols are inappropriate. Some varieties include
    restrained spice doses including coriander and oranges that run with a restrained noble hop character. Due to the strength, alcohol aromas may be detected.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span> Color ranges from hazy straw to pale gold.  Clarity ranges from good to hazy from wheat protein.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor:</span> Honeyed sweet, rich and luscious malty with bready and biscuit tones cut by the combination of carbonation and noble hop bite. Fruit flavors and
    spices may be present in moderation as may the sherry and raisin tones of strong ale oxidation.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel</span><span>:</span>Smooth, sweet, medium-bodied mouthfeel without astringency is typical. Moderate carbonation and protein
    reinforce the impression of a lighter fluffly textured beer. Alcohol warming may be sensed.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall impression:</span> A strong American Wheat ale brewed to provide a sweet, but potent summer strong ale.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span> The style emerged in the late 90's from the Midwest brewing scene.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span>Pale ale malt (well-modified and suitable for single-temperature infusion mashing), wheat malts (40% or more); American noble hop varieties;

  		<h1>13.2 Double ("Imperial'') India Pale Ale</h1>

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span> A prominent hop aroma of floral, grassy, or fruity character of American hops is the rule. Caramel and toasty malt aroma may also be noted, but at
    low aromas in comparison to the hops. Fruitiness from esters or hops may also be present. Due to the strength, alcohol aromas may be detected.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span> Color ranges from medium gold to dark amber.  Clarity ranges from good to hazy from hop haze.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor:</span> Hop flavor is high from American-type hop varieties with assertive hop bitterness. Malt flavor is often low to medium, but should be sufficient to
    cut the hop aspect. Very low levels of diacetyl are acceptable, and fruitiness from the fermentation or hops should add to the overall complexity. Oxidative flavors and alcohol can also be
    present. Small amounts of astringency may be present from the large hop additions.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel:</span> Smooth, medium-bodied mouthfeel without astringency is typical. Moderate carbonation and powerful hop bitterness combine to render the overall
    sensation of a fairly dry and crisp beer. Alcohol warming may be sensed.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall impression:</span> A strong pale ale slewed in balance to hops. This beer is stronger and hoppier than a normal IPA, while not having the same intense malt
    presence of a barleywine. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span> This beer is the outgrowth of the West Coast Microbrewery movement. Imperial IPA's were born to distinguish breweries and satisfy a growing demand
    for beyond the pale hoppy beers. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span>Pale ale malt (well-modified and suitable for single-temperature infusion mashing), crystal malts for malt flavor; American hop varieties with a
    number using newer higher alpha acid varieties. High sulfate and low carbonate water is essential to achieving a pleasant hop bitterness, and many American versions use relatively soft water
    in their makeup. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Vital Statistics:</span> OG - 1.070 - 1.100, FG: 1.012-1.025, ABV: 7.5%-12%, IBU: 70-100+, SRM: 8 - 14.

  		<h1>14.2 Baltic-Style Porter</h1>

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span>Low Fruity esters, reminiscent of dark fruit, merged with intense roastiness and maltiness.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span>Very dark reddish-black color; opaque. Head retention can range from very good to low due to alcohol.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor</span> Intensely malty with subdued fruit, backed up by balancing roastiness and a softer hop bitterness and flavor than found in an Imperial Stout.A "burnt
    currant" character may be present, along with a suggestion of cocoa or strong coffee. Alcoholic strength should be evident, along with a deep, complex malt flavor. The finish is generally
    dry, with stronger examples retaining more sweetness. Finish lingers with caramel sugars and dark roasts. Some examples carry spicy anise and herbal tones in the final profile.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel:</span>Very full-bodied and rich, with intense flavors and perceptible alcohol presence. Carbonation is relatively low. Flavors should be smooth and well
    blended.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> An intensely flavorful beer. Roasty, fruity, and bittersweet, with a notable alcohol presence. Dark fruit melds with roasty chewy
    sensations. Overall, the beer carries many notes of it's parent style, Imperial Stout, but with a smoother, more subtle approach than the overt attacking nature of the Stouts.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>Local brewery response to the creation of the Imperial Stout. Brewed with mostly indigenous ingredients and lager yeasts to take advantage of cool
    local temperatures.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span>Inspired by the importation of Imperial Stouts from Britian. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span>Brewed using ingredients local to the Baltic regions including Pilsner malts, Lublin hops and lager yeasts that are generally used across a
    brewery's product line.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Vital Statistics:</span> OG: 1.070 - 1.095+, FG: 1.017 - 1.030+, ABV: 5.5 - 9.5+%, IBU: 30 - 50, SRM: 25 - 50.

  		<h1>14.3 Imperial ("Russian") Stout</h1>

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span>Fruity esters, reminiscent of dark fruit, merged with intense roastiness and maltiness. Hop aroma is usually also present.

    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>Brewed to high gravity and hopping level in England for export to the Baltic states and Russia. High OG and bittering rates may have helped it age
    in transport.

    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span>Well-modified pale malt, with generous quantities of roasted grain. Flavor and aroma hops should include English varieties for authenticity.
    Alkaline water would balance the abundance of acidic roasted grain in the grist.

  <div data-role="content">
  		<h1>15.1 Maibock and Helles (Pale) Bock</h1>

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span>Moderate to strong malt aroma. Hop aroma should be low to none. Aromas such as diacetyl or fruity esters should be low to none. Some alcohol may be
    noticeable.

    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor</span>The rich flavor of continental European pale malts dominates. Little or no hop flavor. Hop bitterness is generally only high enough to balance the
    malt flavors to allow moderate sweetness in the finish. Perception of hops may be more apparent than in darker Bocks.

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span>Predominantly of malt. Hop aroma is generally low to none. Fruity esters should be very lowto none. No diacetyl.

    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span>Medium to dark brown. Good clarity.

    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel:</span>Usually no more than medium bodied, with low to moderate carbonation. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> A malty, dark American-style lager beer that is a bit stronger than average. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>Most often brewed from a lower original gravity than would be permissible in Germany, for the preferences of the American market. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span>Inspired by the German traditions of Bock beer brewing, as adapted to the American market.

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span>Intense maltiness.  Virtually no hop aroma.  While diacetyl or esters should be low to none, a fruity aspect to the aroma often described as prune,
    plum or grape may be present due to reactions between malt, the boil, and aging.  A very slight roasty aroma may be present in darker versions.  
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span>Gold to dark brown in color.  Lagering should provide good clarity.  Head retention may be impaired by higher-than-average alcohol content.  
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor:</span>Very rich and malty, infrequently a touch of roastiness. Invariably there will be an impression of alcoholic strength, but this should be smooth and
    warming rather than harsh or burning.  Presence of higher alcohols (fusel oils) should be very low to none.  Little to no hop flavor.  Hop bitterness varies from moderate to low but always
    allows malt to dominate the flavor.  
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel:</span>Full-bodied.  Low carbonation.  
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> A very strong, rich, lager beer.  
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span>A Bavarian specialty invented in Munich by the brothers of St. Francis of Paula.  Historical versions were less well attenuated than modern
    interpretations, with consequently higher sweetness and lower alcohol levels.  
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>Most versions are dark colored and may display the caramelizing and melanoidin effect of decoction mashing, but pale versions have also been made. 
    
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span>Pale lager malt for pale versions, Munich and Vienna malts for darker ones and occasionally a small fraction of dark-roasted(burnt) malt in
    those.  Continental European hops. Water hardness will vary.  Lager yeast.  
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Vital Statistics:</span> OG: 1.073 - 1.120, FG: 1.018 - 1.030, IBUs: 20 - 40, SRM: 12 - 30, ABV: 7.5 - 12%

    <span>Mouthfeel:</span>  Full-bodied.  Carbonation low.

    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>The process of concentrating the alcohol content by freezing may impart significant smoothness to the flavor. The effective OG range due to the
    freezing effect is 1.092-1.150.

    <p>
    <span>History:</span>Originating in England, Porter is a precursor to Stout that evolved from a blend of beers or gyles known as "Entire." Said to have been favored by
    porters and other physical laborers.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span>May contain several malts, including dark roasted malts and grains. Hops are used chiefly for bitterness. Water may have significant carbonate

    include some creaminess, high to low fruitiness, and medium to no diacetyl. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel:</span>Medium-light to medium body, with a creamy character. Low to moderate carbonation. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> A very dark, roasty, bitter, creamy ale. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>This is the low-gravity draught version of what is otherwise known as Irish Stout. Bottled versions are typically brewed from a significantly
    higher OG and may be consideredExtra Stouts. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span>The style evolved from attempts to capitalize on the success of London Porters, but reflected a fuller, creamier body. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span>The dryness comes from the use of roasted unmalted barley in addition to pale malt, moderate to high hop bitterness, and good attenuation.
    Flaked unmalted barley may also be used to add a creaminess. A small percentage of soured beer is sometimes added for complexity.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Vital Statistics:</span> OG: 1.035 - 1.050, FG: 1.007 - 1.011, ABV: 3.2 - 5.5%, IBU: 30 - 50, SRM: 35+. 
    </p>

    <p>
    low to none. Occasionally has the aroma of alcohol. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span>Very deep brown to black in color. Clarity usually obscured by deep color. Moderate to low head retention may result from a higher-than-average

    <p>
    <span>Flavor</span>Can range from sweet to dry, with roasted grain character obvious but not sharp. Fruitiness can be low to high, diacetyl medium to none. Hop

    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel:</span>Medium full body, creamy character, occasionally with some thinning effect from significant alcohol content.

    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>These beers possess a much stronger alcohol content than most other Stouts, and as a result the flavor leans toward malt in the balance.

    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span>Generally completely black in color.

    <p>
    <span>Flavor</span> Prominent hop flavor and bitterness.Malty body gives way to a dry, roasty, charcoal-like finish.

    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel:</span>Full bodied. Carbonation moderate. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> A very dark, moderately strong, hoppy, roasty American ale. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>Malt and roast flavors are characteristically bolder than in either Irish or English stout styles. Similarly, higher hop usage provides a much more
    significant role for the hops in aroma, flavor and bitterness than in the traditional stout styles from the British Isles. Original gravities are generally higher than in Irish and English
    Stouts as well. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span>Inspired by Irish and English models, but reflecting typical American experimentation with bolder flavors. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span>Two-row and/or six-row malts. Dark roasted malts and grains. Generally, liberal use of flowery American hops. Adjuncts such as oatmeal may or

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span>Clove-like phenols and fruity esters of banana and vanilla are common. Hop aroma ranges from low to none. No diacetyl. Some aroma of wheat may be
    present. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span>Pale straw to dark reddish gold in color. A very thick, long-lasting head is characteristic. Krystal is by definition a filtered beer and should
    have excellent clarity. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor</span>The soft, grainy flavor of wheat is essential. Hop flavor is low to none and hop bitterness is very low. A tart character from yeast and high

    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel:</span>The texture of wheat imparts the sensation of a fluffy, creamy fullness that may progress to a surprisingly light finish. A high carbonation level

    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> A pale, spicy, fruity, wheat-based ale.

    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span>A high percentage of malted wheat is used which typically constitutes 50% or more of the grist, the remainder being pale barley malt. Weizen ale
    yeasts produce the typical spicy and fruity essences during a relatively warm fermentation. Hops are used for a small amount of bittering only. Water character will vary. Traditional

    <span>Comments:</span>These are refreshing, fast-maturing beers that are lightly hopped. The Hefeweizen version is served with yeast sediment stirred into it.

    <span>History:</span>A traditional wheat-based ale from Southern Germany that is a specialty for summer consumption. Many believe that the yeast content of Hefeweizen

    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel:</span>The texture of wheat imparts the sensation of a fluffy, creamy fullness that may progress to a lighter finish. However, the presence of Munich and

    <span>Overall Impression:</span> A dark, malty, spicy, wheat-based ale.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>The presence of Munich and Vienna-type barley malts give this style a deeper and richer barley malt character than Bavarian Weizen. Often, there is

    <p>
    <span>History:</span>A dark version of Bavarian Weizen.

    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span>Wheat malt typically makes up 50% or more of the grist, the remainder being Munich or Vienna-type high-kilned barley malts. Some dark wheat

    <span>Aroma:</span>Slightly fruity; a sour aspect may be quite noticeable. On occasion a mild Brettanomyces yeast aroma may be present. No hop aroma. No diacetyl. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span>Very pale straw in color. Clarity ranges from fair to cloudy. Despite high carbonation, head retention can vary from moussy to low. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor</span>Lactic sourness dominates and can be quite strong. However, some wheat flavor should be noticeable. Hop bitterness is very low. Mild Brettanomyces

    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel:</span>Light body. High carbonation. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> A very pale, sour, refreshing, low-alcohol wheat ale.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>Often served with the addition of sugar syrups flavored with raspberry or woodruff to counter the substantial sourness. Has been described by some
    as the most purely refreshing beer in the world. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span>A regional specialty of Berlin; referred to by Napoleon's troops in 1809 as "the Champagne of the North" due to its lively and elegant character. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span>Wheat malt content is typically well under 50% of the grist, the remainder being pale barley malt. Lactobacillus delbruckii culture and
    fermentation provides the sharp sourness, which may be enhanced by blending of beers of different ages during ferment and by extended cool aging. Ale yeast ferments to a low alcohol level.
    Hop bitterness is extremely low. Water may have significant hardness.

  </div>
  <div data-role="content">
  		<h1>18.5 Roggenbier (German Rye Beer)</h1>

    <p>
    <span>Aroma</span>: Light to moderate spicy rye aroma intermingled with light to moderate weizen yeast aromatics (spicy clove and fruity esters, either banana or
    citrus).  Light noble hops are acceptable.  Can have a somewhat acidic aroma from rye and yeast.  No diacetyl.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance</span>: Light coppery-orange to very dark reddish or coppery-brown color.  Large creamy off-white to tan head, quite dense and persistent (often thick
    and rocky).  Cloudy, hazy appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor</span>: Grainy, moderately-low to moderately-strong spicy rye flavor, often having a hearty flavor reminiscent of rye or pumpernickel bread.  Medium to
    medium-low bitterness allows an initial malt sweetness (sometimes with a bit of caramel) to be tasted before yeast and rye character takes over.  Low to moderate weizen yeast character
    (banana, clove, and sometimes citrus), although the balance can vary.  Medium-dry, grainy finish with a tangy, lightly bitter (from rye) aftertaste.  Low to moderate noble hop flavor
    acceptable, and can persist into aftertaste.  No diacetyl.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel</span>: Medium to medium-full body.  High carbonation.  Light tartness optional.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression</span>: A dunkelweizen made with rye rather than wheat, but with a greater body and light finishing hops.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History</span>: A specialty beer originally brewed in Regensburg, Bavaria as a more distinctive variant of a dunkelweizen using malted rye instead of malted wheat.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments</span>: American-style rye beers, or traditional beer styles with enough rye added to give a noticeable rye character should be entered in the specialty
    beer category instead.  Rye is a huskless grain and is difficult to mash, often resulting in a gummy mash texture that is prone to sticking.  Rye has been characterized as having the most
    assertive flavor of all cereal grains.  It is inappropriate to add caraway seeds to a roggenbier (as some American brewers do); the rye character is traditionally from the rye grain only.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients</span>: Malted rye typically constitutes 50% or greater of the grist (some versions have 60-65% rye).  Remainder of grist can include pale malt, Munich
    malt, wheat malt, crystal malt and/or small amounts of debittered dark malts for color adjustment.  Weizen yeast provides distinctive banana esters and clove phenols.  Light usage of noble
    hops in bitterness, flavor and aroma.  Lower fermentation temperatures accentuate the clove character by suppressing ester formation.  Decoction mash commonly used (as with weizenbiers).  
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Vital Statistics</span>: OG: 1.046-1.056, FG: 1.010-1.014, ABV: 4.5-6%, IBUs: 10-20, SRM: 14-18.

  		<h1>18.6 Weizenbock</h1>

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span>A powerful aroma of ripe fruit is very common. Aroma of alcohol is also common. Some clove-spice aroma may be present. No hop aroma. No diacetyl. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span>Light amber to dark brown in color. High alcohol level may impair what would otherwise be a thick, long-lasting head. Wheat protein content may
    impair clarity. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor</span>Concentrated wheat flavor is dominant. Malty complexity, including smoky or raisin-like essences, may be present in darker versions. A fruity
    character is common, and some clove-spice flavor may occur. Well-aged examples may show some sherry-like oxidation as a point of complexity. Hop bitterness is well-controlled to allow wheat
    and malt flavors to dominate the balance. No hop flavor. No diacetyl.

    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel:</span>Medium-full to full body. Warming mouthfeel from alcohol.

    none. No diacetyl. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span>Pale gold to deep gold in color. Clarity should be fair to good. Head retention may be quite good, or may be adversely affected by alcohol
    content in some versions.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor</span> Crisp and moderately fruity.Malty sweetness is balanced by restrained hop bitterness and high carbonation to provide a dry finish to the palate
    flavor and a sweet aftertaste. Clove-like spiciness is apparent in many examples. The best examples have subtle alcohol undertones, while others may have very noticeable alcohol presence. Hop
    flavor may be moderate to none. No diacetyl. Some mineral character may be contributed by pale candi sugar derived from beets. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel:</span>Medium body which gives a light impression, given the often substantial final gravity. High alcohol content adds a warming sensation. Carbonation
    is very high and effervescent in character, yet ideally does not disturb the beer's smoothness. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> A pale, moderately fruity, spicy, very strong ale. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>Alcoholic, but the best examples do not taste strongly of alcohol. By Belgian law, to be called a "Trappist Ale" it must be brewed at a Trappist

    <span>Flavor:</span> Complex interplay between the malt, phenols, esters, alcohol, minerals, and hops. The malt should be rich with some caramel coming from dark candy
    sugar. The phenols should be spicy, even peppery. The esters should remind one of dark fruit. The alcohol should be "clean" with fusels very low to medium. Hop flavor should be more of the
    noble character and be low to none. There should always be a good carbonation "bite" and minerals can range from light to moderate; but are often overpowered by the other strong flavors. No
    sourness or diacytel.<br />
    <span>Mouthfeel</span><span>:</span> Fairly dry finish considering the high starting gravity. Perception of sweetness from the residual sugar and

    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span>Yeast strains prone to production of higher alcohols, esters, and clove-spice aroma and flavor are most commonly used. A variety of malts may be

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span> Light earthy or spicy hop nose, along with a lightly sweet Pils malt character.  Shows a subtle yeast character that may include spicy phenolics,
    perfumy or honey-like alcohol, or yeasty, fruity esters (commonly orange-like or lemony).  Light sweetness that may have a slightly sugar-like character.  Subtle yet complex.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor:</span> Smooth, light to moderate Pils malt sweetness initially, but finishes medium-dry to dry with some smooth alcohol becoming evident in the aftertaste.
     Medium hop and alcohol bitterness to balance.  Light hop flavor, can be spicy or earthy.  Very soft yeast character (esters and alcohols, which are sometimes perfumy or orange/lemon-like). 
    Light spicy phenolics optional.  Some lightly caramelized sugar or honey-like sweetness on palate.

    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> A moderate-strength golden ale that has a subtle Belgian complexity, slightly sweet flavor, and dry finish.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span> Relatively recent development to further appeal to European Pils drinkers, becoming more popular as it is widely marketed and distributed.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span> Similar strength as a dubbel, similar character as a Belgian Strong Golden Ale or Tripel, although a bit sweeter and not as bitter.  Often has an
    almost lager-like character, which gives it a cleaner profile in comparison to the other styles. Belgians use the term "Blond," while the French spell it "Blonde."  Most commercial examples
    are in the 6.5 - 7% ABV range.  Many Trappist table beers (singles or Enkels) are called "Blond" but these are not representative of this style.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span> Belgian Pils malt, aromatic malts, sugar, Belgian yeast strains that produce complex alcohol, phenolics and perfumy esters, noble, Styrian
    Goldings or East Kent Goldings hops.  No spices are traditionally used, although the ingredients and fermentation by-products may give an impression of spicing (often reminiscent of oranges

    <span>Appearance:</span>Deep burgundy to dark brown in color. Clarity may be fair to good. Head retention may be quite good or may be adversely affected by high alcohol
    content. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor</span>  Ripe fruit flavors, including raisin and plum, are common. Malt usually dominates, but some examples are balanced slightly toward bitterness. Some
    spicy phenols, from ferment or actual spices, may be present. Hop flavor can range from moderate to none. Some sweetness is contributed by alcohol. No diacetyl. Mouth feel: Medium to full
    body, creamy and warming. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> A dark, very rich, complex, very strong ale. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>In comparison to the Abbey Dubbel style, these are typically significantly stronger beers of a wider variety. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span>Most versions reflect the unique products of individual breweries. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span>Dark candi sugar is a frequently-used additive and may contribute as much or more color and flavor as dark Munich or caramel malts. Spices are
    sometimes added for complexity. Yeasts prone to production of higher alcohols, esters and spicy phenols are commonly employed. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Vital Statistics:</span> OG: 1.065 - 1.098+, FG: 1.014 - 1.024+, ABV: 7 - 12+%, IBU: 25 - 40+, SRM: 7 - 20.

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span>A sweet and occasionally honey-like malt and grain character with prominent citrus (notably orange), herbal and spice aromas is characteristic, and is
    often followed by a mild phenolic aroma. Hop aroma is low to none. No diacetyl. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span>  Very pale straw to very light gold in color, and generally cloudy. Head retention should be quite good and of a moussy character.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor</span>The flavor of unmalted wheat is typically noticeable. Coriander, citrus and mild phenolic flavors contribute to a complex and elegant character. A
    very slight lactic acidity resulting from a limited lactobacillus ferment is present in some examples, providing a refreshing quality, and is absent in others. Hop flavor is low to none. Hop
    bitterness is typically restrained, and some bitterness may also be contributed by bitter orange peel. No diacetyl. Mouth feel: Light to medium body. Effervescent character of high
    carbonation. Refreshing acidity. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> A refreshing, elegant, complex, wheat-based ale. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>The presence and degree of spicing and lactic sourness vary from one brand or brewery to another. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span>A 400 year-old beer style that died out in the 1950s, it was revived by Pierre Celis in the 1960s to steadily growing popularity thereafter. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span>About 50% unmalted hard red winter wheat and 50% pale barley malt constitute the grist; in some versions a small percentage of raw oats is used
    as well. Spices of freshly-ground coriander and dried orange peel complement the sweet aroma and are quite characteristic--other spices may be used for complexity but are much less prominent.
    Ale yeasts prone to production of citrusy esters and mild phenols are very characteristic. In some instances a very limited lactobacillus ferment, or actual addition of lactic acid, is done.

    <span>Aroma:</span>Prominent but soft-edged aroma of malt, accented by small amounts of phenols, higher alcohols in some versions, and spices in some versions. Hop aroma
    low to none. No diacetyl. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span>Golden to copper in color. Clarity is fair to good. Good head retention. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor</span>Fruity and lightly to moderately spicy, with a soft and smooth malt character. Higher alcohols may contribute complexity in some examples, but not
    harshness. Hop flavor is relatively low. Hop bitterness is moderate, though some examples with high bitterness exist. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel:</span>Light to medium in body, with a smooth quality and moderatecarbonation. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> A fruity, slightly spicy, smooth, copper-colored ale. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>Best known as a draught beer, and most often encountered in the Belgian province of Antwerp. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span>Although produced by breweries with roots as far back as the mid-1700s, most well-known products were perfected after the Second World War with some
    influence from Britain including yeast strains. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span>Candi sugar may be used as an additive. Yeasts prone to production of higher alcohols and spiciness may or may not be used. On occasion spices

  		<h1>21.3 Belgian IPA</h1>

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span>Complex aroma of malt, fruity esters which may have a citric essence, and often a mild to moderate clove-spice character. High floral, spicy and
    grassy hop aroma. Some versions offer restrained use of American citrus and pine laden hops. Dry hopping may be used. No diacetyl. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span>Pale gold to orange in color. Clarity should be fair to good. Hop haze is ok. Head retention is quite good due to the foam positive nature of
    hops.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor</span> Crisp and moderately fruity with some spice phenols from the yeast. Malt provides a foundation for an apparently high (for Belgian styles) hop
    bitterness with high carbonation to provide a dry finish to the palate flavor. Hop flavor may be moderate to none. Green grassy herbal hop characters are not uncommon from an abundance of
    kettle hopping with low alpha varieties. No diacetyl. Some versions may verge on "Saison" like characters due to yeast selection. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel</span><span>:</span> Medium body which gives a light impression, given the often substantial final gravity. High alcohol content
    adds a warming sensation. Carbonation is generally high to promote the hop aroma.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> A pale, moderately fruity, spicy, very strong ale with a punch of hops. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>An expansion on the concept of pale Belgian ales like Triple, Golden Strong and some Saisons. Belgian IPAs developed in response to the American
    export market and hoppy craft brews. Belgian versions of the style are usually more restrained in their hopping approach than the American versions.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span>Yeast strains prone to higher alcohol production are usually used. Saison yeasts are not uncommon.  Pale Pilsner malts and pale Crystal malts
    are used. A substantial (25%) addition of sugar (sucrose) is often added to promote a dry finish. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Vital Statistics:</span> OG: 1.065 - 1.095, FG: 1.013 - 1.020, ABV: 6.3 - 10%, IBU: 20 - 55, SRM: 3.5 - 6.

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span>Fruity esters are common, and the malt character is light. Some clove-spice character may be present, from either warm ferment or actual spice
    additions. A spicy hop aroma is sometimes found. No diacetyl. Impressive levels of carbonation push the spicy profile
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span>Pale yellow to dark chocolate brown in color. Good clarity. Long lasting foam stand resulting in characteristic "Belgian Lace" on the glass. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor</span>Full of fruity, hoppy, alcoholic complexity, supported by a soft malt character. A slight presence of spices, from either warm ferment or actual spice
    additions, may be present as a point of complexity. Hop bitterness is typically restrained. Substantial carbonation lends a dry flavor and a slight carbonic acidic touch to the palate despite
    a sweet aftertaste. No diacetyl. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel</span><span>:</span> Unusually effervescent, with a smooth spicy finish that leads to a light feel despite the high alcohol content
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> A very pale, effervescent, complex, strong ale.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>Relatively new style of beer born from the efforts of Belgian breweries conditioning special strong ales via the traditional methode Champenoise. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span>Most versions reflect the unique products of individual breweries. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span>The relatively light body for a beer of this strength are the result of a low mash favoring simple sugars and 20%  or more of sugar (sucrose).
    Some versions include the use of spices for subtle complexity.

  		<h1>21.5 Belgian-Style Specialty Ale, Other</h1>

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span>Most exhibit varying amounts of fruity esters, spicy phenols, and other yeast-borne aromatics; some may include very slight aromas of Brettanomyces
    and other microflora. Hop aroma may be low to moderate. Malt aroma may be low to high and may include essences of grains other than barley, such as wheat or rye. No diacetyl. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span>  Color varies considerably, from pale gold to medium amber. Clarity may be poor to good. Head retention is usually good. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor</span>A great variety of flavor is found in these beers. Maltiness may be light to quite rich, hop flavor and bitterness generally increase along with the
    depth of malt quality, and spicy flavors may be imparted by yeast and or actual spice additions. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel</span><span>:</span> The character of the malt may impart a silky impression. Most are well-attenuated, thus fairly light-bodied,
    and well-carbonated. A warming sensation from alcohol may be present in stronger examples. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> This category encompasses a wide variety of Belgian-style ales that typify the imaginative products often necessary to attract customers
    in the world's most competitive beer market, Belgium.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>A category for the myriad of unusual and distinctive Belgian ales which don't fit into any of the other style descriptions for Belgian-style beers
    contained in these guidelines. These beers run the gamut of aromas, flavors, colors, mouthfeels and alcohol content and are often fermented with unusual and distinctive yeasts and
    ingredients. Brewer should specify commercial equivalent for entry, if appropriate. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span>Unique beers of small independent Belgian breweries that have come to enjoy local popularity, but may be far less well-known outside of their own
    regions.

  		<h1>22.1 Biere de Garde (French-Style Country Ale)</h1>

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span>Malt is prominent in the aroma, which is otherwise complex with a slight level of fruity esters, little or no hop aroma, and often a musty/woody
    character. Higher alcohols may be detected. No diacetyl. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span>Color can vary from full gold, to copper-colored (most common), to a dark reddish brown. Clarity and head retention are generally good. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor</span>A medium to high malt flavor often characterized by toffee or caramel aspects is typical. A slight musty or woody character may be present. Hop
    bitterness is often modest, though subtle and restrained hop flavors may occur. No diacetyl. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel</span><span>:</span> Medium body, which in the best examples has a very smooth, silky character to it. Alcohol level is medium to
    strong and gives a warming sensation. Moderate carbonation. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> A rich, complex, malty, moderately strong ale. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>The name means "Beer For Keeping," denoting a beer that is strong enough to be stored for quite a while. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span>A farmhouse style from northeastern France which reflects the "March beer" tradition of a stronger beer brewed at the end of the cool season to last
    through the warm months. Its revival began in the 1970s after nearly disappearing in the aftermath of World War II. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span>Typically made from pale malts and a Vienna or Munich type. A variety of continental hops displaying very subtle floral or spicy aromas and

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span> Fruity esters dominate the aroma. Complexity is often  contributed by hop aroma, complex higher alcohols, herbs and spices, and appropriate spicy
    phenols. Malt aroma can be complex and toasty, but is not the dominant aroma. No diacetyl.   
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
    <span>Flavor :</span>Spring and Summer Saisons emphasize a bitter, refreshing  character with hoppy, fruity flavors with citric notes possible. Often a 'seasoning' of
    several spices and herbs is found across Saisons. Hop bitterness ranges from low to moderate, and  hop flavor may be moderate to high but should not overwhelm fruity esters, spices, and malt.
    Malt character provides sufficient structure for the other complex flavors, which may include a quenching tartness. No diacetyl.   
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel:</span> Light to full body. Very high carbonation with an effervescent quality. Alcohol level can be medium to high. Should have a dry finish

    <span>Overall Impression:</span> A fruity, highly carbonated, moderately strong, refreshing ale of surprising complexity and depth. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span> Traditional seasonal beers produced in Wallonia, the French-speaking part of Belgium. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span> The style has its origins in the varying seasonal needs of  the residents of Wallonia. It often reflects available plants, spices and other

    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
    Please note this category may require additional specification from the entrant if special ingredients or wood is used to give the judges complete information.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span>Complex aroma of malt, fruity esters, earthy "funky" aromas typical of <i>Brettanomyces</i> and Belgian yeast strains.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span>Color varies from pale straw to pitch black based on ingredients. Haze is typical of the style.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor:</span> Varies greatly from beer to beer. Common characteristics include the earthy, pineapple, leather flavors produced by <i>Brettanomyces</i>. Sourness
    levels can vary from low/none to extremely high with additional micro-organisms. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel</span><span>:</span> Generally light bodied with a low residual gravity due to aggressive fermentation characteristics of the
    <i>Brettanomyces</i>. Carbonation is generally high. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> Eclectic and funky ales that express the crazy side of brewing. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>In both Belgium and the US, brewers expanded the role of various "wild" cultures in their breweries to produce exotic ales that don't fall into the
    traditional historical Sour Ale categories. Entrant should feel free to specify any exotic ingredients added to the brew. Beers that are brewed only with <i>Brettanomyces</i> and without
    <i>Saccharomyces Cerevisiae</i> express fewer of the typical <i>Brett</i> earthiness.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span>Variable according to the effect the brewer wants. Crucial ingredients include the use of non-Saccharomyces Cerevisiae cultures for
    fermentation. This can include various strains of <i>Brettanomyces</i>, <i>Lactobacillus, or Pediococcus.</i> Barrel aging with previously used wood (e.g. spirits or wine) is not uncommon.
    Fruits can play a role 
    </p>
    <p>

    <a href="#home" data-icon="arrow-l" data-rel="back">Back</a> 
  </div>
  <div data-role="content">
    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span>The aroma of these beers is a complex blend of aromas from a wide variety of microbiota. These aromas include: horsey, horse blanket, sweaty, oaky,
    hay, and sour. Other aromas that may be found in small quantities are: enteric, vinegary, and barnyard. There can be a very fruity aroma, and some mustiness may be detected. Typically, no hop
    aroma or diacetyl are perceived. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span>Gold to medium amber color. May be slightly cloudy. Head retention is not expected to be very good.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor</span>Young examples are intensely sour from lactic acid and at times some acetic acid; when aged, the sourness is more in balance with the malt and wheat
    character. Fruit flavors from esters are simpler in young Gueuze and more complex in the older examples. A slight oak, cork or wood flavor is sometimes noticeable. Typically, no hop flavor or
    diacetyl are perceived. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel:</span>Younger bottles (less than 5 years old) tend to be sparkling, but older vintages are at times less carbonated. Light to medium-light body. A very
    faint astringency is often present, like a well-aged wine. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>Gueuze/Geuze is traditionally made by blending 2- or 3-year-old straight Lambic with young (less than 1-year-old) straight Lambic, and
    bottle-conditioned with very young straight Lambic without the use of priming sugar. Homebrewed versions are usually primed. Typically, Gueuze/Geuze has a smoother palate than straight
    Lambic. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> Intensely refreshing, fruity, complex, sour, pale wheat-based ales fermented with a variety of microflora.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span>Uniquely sour ales from the Senne (Zenne) Valley of Belgium which stem from a farmhouse brewing tradition several centuries old. Gueuze is the
    French spelling, while Geuze is the Flemish spelling. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span>Unmalted wheat (30 to 40%) and aged hops are used. Traditionally, these beers are spontaneously fermented and aged with naturally occuring yeast
    and bacteria in oak or chestnut barrels. Homebrewed and craft-brewed versions are more typically made with pure cultures of yeast, including Saccharomyces and Brettanomyces, along with
    Pediococcus and Lactobacillus bacteria, in an attempt to recreate the effects of dominant microflora of the Senne/Zenne valley. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Vital Statistics:</span> OG: 1.044 - 1.056, FG: 1.006 - 1.012, ABV: 4.7 - 5.8%, IBU: 10 - 15, SRM: 4 - 15.

  		<h1>23.2 Fruit-Flavored Lambic-Style Ale and Faro</h1>

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span>In younger vintages, the fruit with which the beer has been flavored should be the dominant aroma. In old bottles, the fruit aroma typically has faded
    and other aromas are more noticeable: horsey, horse blanket, sweaty, oaky, hay, and sour. Other aromas that may be found in small quantities are: enteric, vinegary, and barnyard. Lambics can
    be very fruity from esters as well. Typically, no hop aroma or diacetyl are perceived. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span>May be slightly cloudy. Head retention is not expected to be very good. The variety of fruit determines the color. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor</span>Young examples are intensely sour from lactic acid and at times some acetic acid; when aged, the sourness is more in balance with the fruit, malt and
    wheat character. Fruit flavors are simpler and more one-dimensional in young Lambics (the fruit added being dominant) and more complex in the older examples. A slight oak, cork or wood flavor
    is sometimes noticeable. Typically, no hop flavor or diacetyl are perceived. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel:</span>Younger bottles (less than 5 years) tend to be sparkling, older vintages are sometimes less carbonated. Light to medium-light body. A very faint
    astringency is acceptable, like a well-aged wine. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>Commonly made by blending 2- or 3-year-old straight Lambic with young (less than 1-year-old) straight Lambic, after which fruit is added for
    further fermentation and aging before bottle-conditioning with very young straight Lambic. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> Intensely refreshing, fruit-flavored, complex, sour, pale wheat-based ales fermented with a variety of microflora. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span>Uniquely sour ales from the Senne (Zenne) Valley of Belgium which stem from a farmhouse brewing tradition several centuries old. The addition of
    fruit for flavoring may be a relatively recent post-World War II innovation, however. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span>A blend of older and younger straight Lambics is used as a base. Fruits commonly used for flavoring are cherries (Kriek) and raspberries
    (Framboise) although more recent commercial examples include peaches (Peche), grapes (Vigneronne or Muscat) and black currants (Cassis). Entrant should specify the type of fruit used in
    making the entry. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Vital Statistics:</span> OG: 1.044 - 1.056 (plus the fruit), FG: 1.006 - 1.012, ABV: 4.7 - 5.8%, IBU: 10 - 15, SRM: 4 - 15.
    </p>
    <p>
    Commercial Examples: Cantillon Rose de Gambrinus (25% cherries, 75% raspberries), Cantillon Kriek, and Cantillon Gueuze Vigneronne. Drie Fontainen Kriek. Hanssens Kriek. Boon Kriek Marriage
    Parfait and Boon Framboise Marriage Parfait.

  <div data-role="content">
  		<h1>23.3 Straight (Unblended) Lambic-Style Ale</h1>

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span>The aroma of these beers is a complex blend from a wide variety of microbiota, often described in the following terms: horsey, horse blanket, sweaty,
    oaky, hay, and sour. Other aromas that are found in small quantities are:enteric, vinegary and barnyard. Lambics can also be very fruity, and a corky or woody character may also be detected
    on occasion. Typically, no hop aroma or diacetyl are perceived. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span>May be slightly cloudy. Head retention is not expected to be very good. Yellow to gold color. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor</span>Young examples are intensely sour lactic acid and at times some acetic acid; when aged, the sourness is more in balance with the malt and wheat
    character. Fruit flavors are simpler in young lambics and more complex in the older examples. Some oak or wood flavor is sometimes noticeable. Hop bitterness is low to none. Hop flavor is
    absent. Typically, no diacetyl is perceived.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel:</span>Medium-light in body from significant wheat content. Bottled Lambic Ales vary from well-carbonated to no carbonation, and draft Lambic is
    virtually flat. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> Complex, sour, pale wheat-based ales fermented with a variety of microflora. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>Straight lambics have a fruity complexity and intense acidity, and very few are bottled. Blended, aged and bottle-conditioned lambics, called
    Gueuze or Gueze, tend to have a smoother palate. Lambic is spelled "Lambiek" in Flemish.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span>Uniquely sour ales from the Senne (Zenne) Valley of Belgium which stem from a farmhouse brewing tradition several centuries old. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span>Unmalted wheat (30 to 40%) and aged hops are used. Traditionally, these beers are spontaneously fermented with naturally occuring yeast and
    bacteria in oak or in some cases chestnut barrels. Homebrewed and craft-brewed versions are more typically made with pure cultures of yeast, including Saccharomyces and Brettanomyces, along
    with Pediococcus and Lactobacillus bacteria, in an attempt to recreate the effects of the dominant microflora of the Senne/Zenne valley.

    <span>Vital Statistics:</span> OG: 1.044 - 1.056, FG: 1.006 - 1.012, ABV: 4.7 - 5.8%, IBU: 10 - 15, SRM: 4 - 15. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Commercial examples: Very few straight (unblended) Lambics are bottled; most commonly available is Grand Cru Cantillon Bruocsella 1900. In the area around Brussels/Bruxelles, there are
    specialty cafes that have draught Lambics from traditional brewers such as Boon, Cantillon, De Neve, Girardin, Hanssens, Vander Linden and Timmermans.

  <div data-role="content">
  		<h1>23.4 Oud Bruin</h1>

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span>Deep complexity of fruity esters and Munich-type malt, including notes of raisins and sherry wine in well-aged examples.  A slight sour aroma may be
    present.  Hop aroma is very low to none.  Diacetyl is typically medium-low to none.  
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span>Dark reddish-brown to brown color.  Good clarity.  Average to good head retention.  
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor:</span>Malty, with fruity complexity and some caramelization character.  A slight sourness may become more pronounced in well-aged examples, along with some
    sherry-like character, producing a "sweet-and-sour" profile.  Hop flavor is low to none. Hop bitterness is restrained.  Diacetyl is medium-low to none.  
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel:</span>Medium body.  Some oak character may be present but not to the point of high astringency.  The astringency should be like that of a  wine, but no
    more than a well-aged red wine.  
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> A malty, complex, aged, sour brown ale.  
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span>An "old ale" tradition typified by the products of the Liefman's brewery in East Flanders, which has roots dating back to the 1600's.  Historically
    brewed as a "provision beer" which would develop some sourness as it aged.  
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>Long aging and blending of young and well-aged beer may occur, adding to smoothness and complexity.  A deeper malt character and less of the
    sourness of lactic or acetic acid distinguishes these beers from Flanders red ales.  
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span>A blend of Vienna and Munich malts are used as the base with smaller amounts of crystal malts also used.  Ale yeast, <i>Lactobacillus</i> and
    some acetobacters may all contribute to the ferment and flavor.  Water high in sodium bicarbonate is typical of its home region and may buffer the acidity of darker malts and the lactic
    sourness.  As in fruit lambics, Oud Bruin can be used as a base for fruit-flavored beers such as kriek (cherries) or frambozen (raspberries).
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Vital Statistics:</span> OG: 1.042 - 1.060, FG: 1.008 - 1.016, IBUs: 14 - 25, SRM: 10 - 20, ABV: 4 - 5.8%

  </div>
  <div data-role="content">
  		<h1>26.1 Bavarian Rauch (smoke-flavored)</h1>

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span>The aroma should be a balance between the expected aroma of the base beer (e.g. Marzen) and the smokiness imparted by the use of smoked malts.
    Smokiness may vary from low to assertive, however, balance in the overall presentation is the key to well made examples. Smoky aroma may range from faint to assertive. Some malt should be
    evident in the low- to moderately-smoked examples. Note that the smoke character can vary among smoked malts. Hop aroma is usually negligible to very low. If a classic Bavarian Rauchbier,
    some aroma of Munich malt from the Marzen style on which this is based should be evident. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span>Varies with the base beer style. If a classic Bavarian Rauchbier, this should be a very clear beer, with rich creamy head, and the color should
    be amber, copper to dark brown. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor</span>As with aroma, there should be a balance between smokiness and the expected flavor characteristics of the base beer style. Smokiness may vary from low
    to assertive. Smoky flavors may range from woodsy to slightly bacony depending on the type of malts used. Balance in the use of smoke, hops and malt character is exhibited by the better
    examples. If this beer is based on a classic style, then the specific classic style (e.g. Bock) must be identified. In this case the beer will be judged on its merits as the classic style and
    how well that smoke flavor and aroma integrate with the beer and are exhibited. If the entry is a classic Bavarian Rauchbier, it should exhibit sweet maltiness from the underlying
    Maerzen/Oktoberfest style of beer with smoke flavors ranging from low to high, but balanced with the malt and hop bitterness; the smoke flavor from Beechwood kilning tends to be somewhat
    drier and neutral in character, although it can vary among maltsters, blending well with the sweetness of the malt, and this beer will exhibit low to medium hop bitterness, low to no hop
    flavor, and the clean characteristics of a lager with no fruitiness or diacetyl. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel:</span>Varies with the base beer style. If a classic Bavarian Rauchbier, it should display a medium body with a good, medium level of carbonation and a
    smooth finish due to lagering. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> A harmonious marriage of beer and smoke flavor/aroma. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>Examples of other smoked beer styles are available in Germany, such as the Bocks, Helles and Vienna-like beers labelled as Spezial Lager. The
    process of using smoked malts more recently has been adapted to other styles, notably Porter and Scotch Ales. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span>Many are experimental beers intended to capture some synergy between traditional brewing ingredients and smoke flavor. Classic Bavarian Rauchbier is
    in the tradition of Bamberg in the Franconian region of Germany, and is a Maerzen/Oktoberfest style of beer made with malts kilned over moist beechwood log embers which impart a smoky flavor
    and aroma to the beer. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span>Different materials used to smoke malt result in unique flavor and aroma characteristics. Because of the unique flavored rendered to malts by
    various smoking materials, Beechwood-kilned malts, not malts smoked with peat, hickory or other woods, are used and will make up 5% to 50% of the malt bill; German or Czech hops. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Vital Statistics:</span> OG: 1.050 - 1.064, FG: 1.012 - 1.016, ABV: 4.8 - 6.5%, IBU: 20 - 30, SRM: 7-16.

    <span>Ingredients:</span>Different materials used to smoke malt result in unique flavor and aroma characteristics. Beechwood, peat, or other hardwood (alder and
    fruitwoods suggested) smoked malts may be used. Hickory wood often results in a bacon/spare-ribs flavor and aroma, while alder wood smoked malt results in a smoked salmon taste. Evergreen
    wood should never be used due to the creosote giving a medicine-like, piney flavor to the malt.

    <span>Vital Statistics:</span> These factors will vary with the base beer.

  		<h1>26.3 Wood-Aged Beer, Whiskey</h1>

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span> Varies with base style.  A low to moderate wood- or oak-based aroma is usually present.  Fresh wood can occasionally impart raw "green" aromatics,
    although this character should never be too strong.  Other optional aromatics include a low to moderate vanilla, caramel, toffee, toast, or cocoa character, as well as any aromatics
    associated with alcohol previously stored in the wood (if any).  Any alcohol character should be smooth and balanced, not hot.  Some background oxidation character is optional, and can take
    on a pleasant, sherry-like character and not be papery or cardboard-like.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span> Varies with base style. Often darker than the unadulterated base beer style, particularly if toasted/charred oak and/or whiskey/bourbon barrels
    are used.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor:</span> Varies with base style. Wood usually contributes a woody or oaky flavor, which can occasionally take on a raw "green" flavor if new wood is used. 
    Other flavors that may optionally be present include vanilla (from vanillin in the wood); caramel, butterscotch, toasted bread or almonds (from toasted wood); coffee, chocolate, cocoa (from
    charred wood or bourbon casks); and alcohol flavors from other products previously stored in the wood (if any).  The wood and/or other cask-derived flavors should be balanced, supportive and
    noticeable, but should not overpower the base beer style.  Occasionally there may be an optional lactic or acetic tartness or Brett funkiness in the beer, but this should not be higher than a
    background flavor (if present at all).  Some background oxidation character is optional, although this should take on a pleasant, sherry-like character and not be papery or cardboard-like.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Mouthfeel</span><span>:</span> Varies with base style. Often fuller than the unadulterated base beer, and may exhibit additional alcohol
    warming if wood has previously been in contact with other alcoholic products.  Higher alcohol levels should not result in "hot" beers; aged, smooth flavors are most desirable.  Wood can also
    add tannins to the beer, depending on age of the cask.  The tannins can lead to additional astringency (which should never be high), or simply a fuller mouthfeel.  Tart or acidic
    characteristics should be low to none.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Overall Impression:</span> A harmonious blend of the base beer style with characteristics from aging in contact with wood (including any alcoholic products
    previously in contact with the wood).  The best examples will be smooth, flavorful, well-balanced and well-aged.  <i>Beers made using either limited wood aging or products that only provide a
    subtle background character may be entered in the base beer style categories as long as the wood character isn't prominently featured. </i> 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>History:</span> A traditional production method that is rarely used by major breweries, and usually only with specialty products.  Becoming more popular with
    modern American craft breweries looking for new, distinctive products.  Oak cask and barrels are traditional, although other woods can be used.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span> The base beer style should be apparent.  The wood-based character should be evident, but not so dominant as to unbalance the beer.  The intensity
    of the wood-based flavors is based on the contact time with the wood; the age, condition, and previous usage of the barrel; and the type of wood.  Any additional alcoholic products previously
    stored in the wood should be evident (if declared as part of the entry), but should not be so dominant as to unbalance the beer.  <b><span>IF</span> THIS BEER IS BASED

    with Oak Chips, Bourbon Barrel-aged Imperial Stout, American Barleywine in an Oak Whiskey Cask).  The brewer should specify any unusual ingredients in either the base style or the wood if
    those characteristics are noticeable.  Specialty or experimental base beer styles may be specified, as long as the other specialty ingredients are identified.  THIS CATEGORY SHOULD NOT BE

    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Ingredients:</span> Varies with base style.  Aged in wooden casks or barrels (often previously used to store whiskey, bourbon,), or using wood-based additives
    (wood chips, wood staves, oak essence).  Fuller-bodied, higher-gravity base styles often are used since they can best stand up to the additional flavors, although experimentation is

    <span>Aroma:</span>Honey aroma should dominate, which may be sweet and may express the aroma of flower nectar.  Aromas produced during fermentation, such as fruity

    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>Mead made from honey from a particular flower source.  The brewer must name the varietal honey. Note that the character of a varietal honey will be
    identifiable as distinct to the source, but may not resemble the source.  Orange-blossom honey has the character of orange blossoms, not oranges.  Blackberry honey is only distantly like
    blackberries, although it is an identifiable character. While some oxidation of mead is OK and can actually lend useful complexity to the mead, over oxidation as exhibited by sherry-like
    aroma and/or taste should be avoided.  Phenols produced by high temperature fermentation are also to be avoided.  <span>Entrants must specify whether the entry is still

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span>Should have distinct apple character with a pronounced honey aroma, which may be sweet and may express the aroma of flower nectar. Aromas produced
    during fermentation, such as fruity esters, low levels of sulfur and alcohol, may also be present.

    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor:</span>Should have distinct apple character but should also have a balanced honey character.  The Apple character may supply tart acidity to cut the honey
    sweetness, so one may notice tart acidity first and residual sweetness thereafter.  Any additives, such as acidity or tannin, should enhance the honey flavor and lend balance to the overall
    character of the cyser.  In well made examples of the style, the fruit is both distinctive and well-incorporated into the sugar-acid balance of the mead.  Some of the best examples have the
    taste and aroma of an aged Calvados (apple brandy from northern France).

    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>There should be an appealing blend of the fruit and honey character but not necessarily an even balance.  Generally a good tannin-sweetness balance

  		<h1>27.5 Melomel</h1>

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span>Should exhibit the aroma of the fruit(s) present in the mead. In a melomel with a blend of fruits, one fruit may dominate the aroma profile.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span>Clarity will be good to brilliant.  Carbonated examples will show active evidence of dissolved gas but no head is expected.  The particular

    <p>
    <span>Flavor:</span> Fruit flavor contributions to the mead range from subtle acidic notes to intense, instantly recognizable fruit flavors.  In a melomel with a blend
    of fruits, one fruit may dominate the flavor profile. There should be a balanced honey character as well.  Some fruits will lend a cloying sweetness to the mead while others add a drying
    character.  In well- made examples of the style, the fruit is both distinctive and well-incorporated into the sugar-acid balance of the mead.

    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span> Generally a good tannin-sweetness balance is desired, though very dry and very sweet examples do exist.  Some fruits, notably darker ones like
    Blackberries, may contribute a tannin presence not unlike dark pyments.  Some oxidative properties may be appropriate in certain fruit meads, giving them a sherry or port wine character.

    <p>
    <span>Aroma:</span> The spices/herbs may be expressed in the aroma.  Honey characters should appear in the aroma but will vary in intensity depending on the spices/herbs
    used.  Metheglins containing more than one spice should have a good balance among the different spices/herbs, though some spices/herbs will tend to dominate the aroma profile.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Appearance:</span>Clarity may be good to brilliant.  Carbonated examples will show active evidence of dissolved gas but no head is expected.  Color may range from
    pale straw to deep amber; the color usually won't be affected by the spices or herbs. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Flavor:</span>The spices/herbs should be expressed in the flavor but the honey character is still the backbone of the mead and should appear in the flavor but will
    vary in intensity depending on the spices/herbs used.  The spices/herbs should be expressed in the flavor as a distinctive enhancement to the honey flavor, whether harmoniously or by
    contrast, and should achieve a pleasant balance when a blend of spices/herbs is used.  Metheglins containing more than one spice should have a good balance among the different spices/herbs,
    though some spices/herbs will tend to dominate the flavor profile.

    character should be avoided; however,  some spices or herbs may affect mouthfeel particularly by adding astringency.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span> Often, a blend of spices may give a character greater than the sum of its parts.  The better examples of this style use spices/herbs subtly and

    <p>
    <span>Comments:</span>The fermentable sugars should come from a balance of malt and honey, otherwise the beverage might better be entered as a Specialty Beer with the
    addition of honey.  As a rule of thumb, the fermentables should consist of no less than 1/3 malt and no more than 2/3 honey.  Hopped examples of this style should exhibit the hops distinctly

    May be dry to sweet. Some noticeable alcohol character may be present but the emphasis should be on alcoholic warming, not the taste or harsh bite of alcohol in the mouth. There should be a
    balance in the acidic character and the residual sweetness.

    <span>Comments:</span>Sugar adjuncts may be used. May  be fermented by wine, Champagne, ale, lager or wild yeast. There may be optional ingredients such as fruits and
    spices in which case the entrant must identify these. The entrant must also specify whether the entry is; dry, semi-dry or sweet; still or carbonated. Artificial carbonation is allowed. The
    method of carbonation need not be specified. The entrant must be careful in the use of honey as an adjunct; if the honey is the dominant fermentable the entry is a Cyser and must be entered
    in the Mead competition and not as a cider.
    </p>
